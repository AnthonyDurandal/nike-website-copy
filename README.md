# nike-website-copy

## A copy of the nike website with maybe some additionnal features later.
-I built this app to master developpement with docker, that's why I chose to use multiple languages (Java backend/Javascript frontend) to make the task harder.
-As a nike website copy, it's a sale/retail website of clothes
-I learned:
    -to create/build a docker container
    -use docker compose to manage multiple containers

## Installation
